# CF-YOLO: Context-Aware Feature Refinement for Camouflaged Industrial Micro-Defect Detection


**Context-Aware** | **Feature-Refined** | **Camouflaged Anomaly Detection**

</div>

## 📖 Introduction

This is the official implementation of the paper: **"CF-YOLO: Context-Aware Feature Refinement for Camouflaged Industrial Micro-Defect Detection"**.

**CF-YOLO** is a novel real-time detection framework specifically designed for **industrial surface defect detection** (e.g., copper tubes), where anomalies are often minute and visually camouflaged against complex backgrounds. 

To tackle the challenges of weak feature representations and high false positive rates, our method integrates two key innovations into the YOLO baseline:

1.  **Context-Perception Aggregation Module (CPAM):** Synergises large-kernel perception for macro-texture context with small-kernel aggregation for sharp boundary delineation, effectively breaking background camouflage.
2.  **Feature Additive Refinement Module (FARM):** Employs a linear-complexity additive token mixer to globally verify and refine fine-grained anomaly representations, suppressing noise-induced errors.

Additionally, we introduce the **Copper Tube Defect Dataset (CTDD)**, a large-scale annotated benchmark to support research in this domain. Extensive experiments on CTDD demonstrate that CF-YOLO surpasses strong baselines like **YOLOv11**, achieving improvements of **2.2% in mAP@50** and **3.9% in Precision**, while maintaining real-time inference speed.
